## ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm pickle, a self-taught web developer.

I have an old [website](https://fwgfs.pages.dev/) for games, which I don't want to make prettier.

If you are wondering where my repositories are, they are private.

I'm bored right now, so go to [requests](https://github.com/pickle69420/requests) and follow the tutorial to request me to do something. It's a win-win!

```javascript
if (needsomething == true) {
 Ask(pickle69420, whatyouneed, requests);
}
```

Thanks for reading this far ðŸ™‚
