## ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm pickle, a self-taught developer.

I specialize in mostly frontend web development and minecraft plugins.

I'm also working on a bookmarklet proxy site with many features like chat and games.
It's called PickleHub, and you can follow it's development on the [github repository](https://github.com/pickle69420/picklebox).
Its sadly currently at halt right now though.

Also, I used to have an obsession with terminals so I have 2 javascript terminals here on github.
There's [The Terminal](https://github.com/pickle69420/theterminal) and [Evol Tech](https://github.com/evoltech-official/).

![pickle's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=pickle69420&show_icons=true&theme=dark)

```javascript
githubapi.getUser(pickle69420).projects = new Array([
  'picklehub:in-progress(late-beta)',
  'evol-tech:alive(first-commit)',
  'fwgfs:deprecated(2020)',
  'theterminal:deprecated(2020-2021)',
]);
```

Thanks for reading this far ðŸ™‚.
