## ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm pickle, a self-taught developer.

I specialize in mostty frontend web development and minecraft plugins.

I'm currently working on a Open-World Massively Multiplayer Online Action RPG in Minecraft called DrippedLeaf.
Join the development server: `drippedleaf.gq`

I'm also working on a bookmarklet proxy site with many features like chat and games.
It's called PickleHub, and you can follow it's development on the [github repository](https://github.com/pickle69420/picklebox).

Also, I used to have an obsession with terminals so I have 2 javascript terminals here on github.
There's [The Terminal](https://github.com/pickle69420/theterminal) and [Evol Tech](https://github.com/pickle69420/evol-tech).

```javascript
githubapi.getUser(pickle69420).projects = new Array([
  'drippedleaf:in-progress(alpha)',
  'picklehub:in-progress(late-beta)',
  'fwgfs:deprecated(2020)',
  'theterminal:deprecated(2020-2021)',
  'evol-tech:maybe-alive(2021)'
]);
```

Thanks for reading this far ðŸ™‚.
